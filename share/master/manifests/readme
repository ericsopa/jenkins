Step 1. "make manifests" will copy init.pp and site.pp from:
	/home/vagrant/jenkins/share/master/manifests/
	to
	/etc/puppet/manifests/
	and copy the sysconfig "jenkins" file from:
	/home/vagrant/jenkins/share/master/modules/
	to
	/etc/puppet/manifests/modules
 
Step 2. "puppet agent -t" will:
	i. Deploy Jenkins on agent
	ii. invoke file{} in /etc/puppet/manifests/site.pp and copy the sysconfig "jenkins" file from:
	/etc/puppet/modules/sysconfig/ on master
	to
	/etc/sysconfig/jenkins on agent
